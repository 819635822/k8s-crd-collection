# k8s-crd-collection
common k8s crd files 


how to use these? 
for example:
with IDEA , there is a plugin named `kubenates` , you need to install it by yourself , and then you can edit `.yaml` within IDEA with code completion and k8s resource document , but the plugin doesn't know resource's specfication which doesn't provide by k8s , you can open `setting` -> `Language&Framework` -> `kubenates` and add these crds to use code completion and resource document
